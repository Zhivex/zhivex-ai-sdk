# @zhivex-ai/meta

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Harden the shared runtime and make its architectural boundaries explicit. File-backed generation caches now use private atomic hashed storage with bounded reads, safe cache-key canonicalization, and explicit authentication scopes; abort composition preserves reasons and supports cleanup; and circuit breakers cover streamed failures with per-model half-open probes.

  Add focused Core entrypoints, discriminated Beta capability profiles, provider-neutral resource dispatch, and generic callable adapters that retain every provider's modeled options. The SDK now owns the release-managed default model catalog, exposes explicit Beta and Experimental entrypoints, and machine-checks its curated relationship to Core exports.
