# @zhivex-ai/azure-openai

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Refresh the release-managed model catalog for September 2026, including Astra, Claude 5.1, Gemini 3.8, Muse Spark 1.3, Lyria 3.5, and Qwen. Preserve the frozen core compatibility snapshot and historical retired Kimi entries while removing retired-model recommendations.

  Route OpenAI/Azure Astra through Responses by default and validate its request controls. Add explicit Azure Responses mode for opaque deployment names and normalize Responses reasoning and named tool choice. Validate Gemini 3.8 sampling/prefill/reasoning, recognize Qwen Max/Flash snapshots and Ollama Qwen 3.8, and reject forced tool choices for Claude 5.1. Add typed Claude progress-display and thinking-binding controls with automatic beta headers.

  Catalog additions and offline regression coverage do not imply authenticated model availability or complete parity with every new upstream protocol.

## 0.6.12

### Patch Changes

- Harden the shared runtime and make its architectural boundaries explicit. File-backed generation caches now use private atomic hashed storage with bounded reads, safe cache-key canonicalization, and explicit authentication scopes; abort composition preserves reasons and supports cleanup; and circuit breakers cover streamed failures with per-model half-open probes.

  Add focused Core entrypoints, discriminated Beta capability profiles, provider-neutral resource dispatch, and generic callable adapters that retain every provider's modeled options. The SDK now owns the release-managed default model catalog, exposes explicit Beta and Experimental entrypoints, and machine-checks its curated relationship to Core exports.

### Patch Changes

- fc64a26: Promote the shared realtime and live-agent contract to Stable. Harden session
  lifecycle, browser transport and frame encoding, tool-call deduplication,
  post-tool continuation, cancellation, durable idempotency, memory context, and
  fail-closed approvals. Correct provider capability claims and Google/Qwen Live
  protocol handling, and add deterministic installed-package plus live
  Gemini/Qwen/OpenAI certification gates.
